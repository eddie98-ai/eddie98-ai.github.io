I am a passionate AI and MLOps Engineer dedicated to solving real-world problems through technology. My expertise lies at the intersection of **AI research**, **cloud computing**, and **software development**.

Currently, as the Lead DevOps & MLOps Engineer at Maly Tech Ltd, I architect and manage robust, scalable infrastructure for AI-powered fintech applications on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. I specialize in building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines with GitLab, implementing full-stack MLOps workflows, and ensuring cloud security and compliance.

My academic background is in Information Systems Engineering from HIAST, where I graduated **first in my class**. My thesis, *Deep Learning for Launching and Thwarting Attacks on AI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)*, involved developing a novel framework using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to create polymorphic poisoning attacks and integrating **SHAP** for model explainability. This research honed my skills in both offensive and defensive AI, driving my interest in creating resilient and transparent machine learning systems.

Beyond my core technical roles, I enjoy engaging in leadership roles, contributing to the open-source community, and mentoring.

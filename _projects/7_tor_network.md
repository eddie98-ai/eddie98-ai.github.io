The TOR (The Onion Router) network provides anonymity by encrypting and routing internet traffic through a volunteer-operated network. While a vital tool for privacy, it is also exploited for malicious activities. The challenge is that TOR traffic is heavily encrypted, making it difficult to distinguish from normal HTTPS traffic using traditional methods. This project addresses this challenge by using machine learning to identify TOR flows based on their behavioral characteristics rather than their content.

### 1. Data Collection and Curation

A significant part of this project was the creation of a high-quality, custom dataset for training and evaluation.
- **Data Collection:** Raw network traffic data was captured at Al-Sham Private University (ASPU), including a mix of standard HTTPS traffic and traffic specifically generated by browsing through the TOR network.
- **Data Curation:** The captured data was processed to create two distinct datasets:
    1.  A newly curated dataset containing a balanced mix of TOR and non-TOR flows captured locally.
    2.  A standard dataset used for benchmarking and validating the models' performance against established results.

### 2. Feature Engineering

Since the packet content is encrypted, the core of the detection methodology relies on **feature engineering** from metadata and traffic flow characteristics. The goal is to find behavioral patterns that are unique to TOR traffic. Key engineered features included:
- **Packet Size Statistics:** Mean, standard deviation, and variance of packet sizes within a flow.
- **Inter-Arrival Times:** The timing patterns between packets, which can differ significantly between TOR's multi-hop routing and direct HTTPS connections.
- **Flow Duration and Volume:** The total length and data volume of a communication session.
- **TLS Handshake Parameters:** Metadata from the initial (unencrypted) TLS handshake, such as cipher suites offered.

### 3. Model Development and Evaluation

Several machine learning classifiers were built and trained to distinguish between the encrypted TOR and non-TOR flows. The models included:
- **Tree-based Models:** Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, chosen for their ability to handle diverse feature types and their inherent explainability.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Evaluated for their effectiveness in finding an optimal separating hyperplane in high-dimensional feature space.

The models were rigorously evaluated on both the standard and the newly curated datasets, measuring their **accuracy, precision, and recall**. The results contributed to research in network security and traffic analysis by demonstrating the viability of using behavioral characteristics to identify encrypted TOR traffic with a high degree of confidence.
